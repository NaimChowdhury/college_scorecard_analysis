# college_scorecard_analysis

In this project, Sumitra Sankarasubramanian, Jamie Hobbs, and Naeem will perform exploratory data analysis and data munging to answer curious questions about college students, debt, and financial outcomes.

## Questions

- How long does it take the average student to pay off their debt?

- How has the relationship between tuition and debt changed over time? (First answer for a single year, then answer over multiple years.) 

- Ethnicity over time by region

## 10/08/2019

Initial change.

### Current Goals:

- Make a large merged CSV which contains the data spanning several years.

- Write 9-15 questions for us to answer in our analysis.

- Come up with 2 good quality measurements
